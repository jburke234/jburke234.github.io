## About Me

Hi, I'm James

A Software Developer with particular interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, AI and Cloud Technologies. I'm currently based in and looking for exciting development opportunities in Vancouver, BC. If you know of any feel free to reach out!

I hold a BSc. in Software Development, awarded by Munster Technical University in Ireland. I also have aspirations of completing an MSc. in AI in the near future.

As a person, I'm an organised, self starter with a passion for continual growth. Outside of work my hobbies are soccer, music and programming. I do also enjoy a book or two from time to time, but these are largely focussed on programming with the odd science fiction one thrown in.
