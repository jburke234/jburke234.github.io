# About Me

Hi, I'm James.

I'm a Software Developer originally from Ireland, living in Vancouver, BC. My development interests centre around the following topics Data Structures & Algorithms, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI and Cloud Technologies. I'm currently looking for exciting development opportunities in Vancouver. If you know of any feel free to reach out!

I hold a BSc. in Software Development, awarded in 2019 by Munster Technical University in Ireland. I have aspirations of furthering my qualifications by undertaking an MSc. in AI and the AWS certifications.

As a person, I'm an organised, self starter with a passion for continual growth. Outside of work my hobbies are soccer, music and programming. I do also enjoy a book or two from time to time, but these are largely focussed on programming with the odd science fiction one thrown in.
