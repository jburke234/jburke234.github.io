Goals are an important part of my process of personal growth. I thought it would be nice to share what I'm targeting for the upcoming year.

Below are a couple of things I have earmarked and some I've already begun working towards achieving. In addition to the below I have started to research potential part-time MSc programes in the fields of AI, Data Science and MAchine Learning.

If you have any suggestions of technologies I might benefit from learning please do let me know.
